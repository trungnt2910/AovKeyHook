# AovKeyHook - Windows 11 Windows Subsystem for Android Key Mapper for Arena of Valor

This is a work-in-progress key mapper for _Liên Quân Mobile_, the Vietnamese version of [Arena of Valor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena_of_Valor) running on Windows 11's WSA.

It uses the Win32 API to simulate touches and expects a window named "_Liên Quân Mobile_" to be active.

For more details, see the [GameMap file](AovKeyHook/GameMap.cs).

This project is currently abandoned, but if you want it to continue (for example, extending support for your favorite Android games), please open an issue and/or give me a star!
